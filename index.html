            <p>Hi! You can call me Dee. Currently, I work at Rocket Mortgage as an Examination Specialist, which is a fancy way of saying that I conduct audits for the company. My team is like air traffic controlling - we make sure that exams are appropriately managed and any issues are directed to the correct business areas to address (when necessary). I have been interested in coding for awhile. In the past, I attended workshops, however, never took the necessary steps to take an extensive program. Recently, I enrolled in the MSU Coding Bootcamp and am thrilled to see how much I grow and learn! </p>

            <p>Multiple actions where taken to ensure that the code was cleaned up. Repetitive code was eliminated by using HTML and CSS rules. Navigation was corrected to make sure links worked correctly. The website is more functional and user-friendly.</p>
